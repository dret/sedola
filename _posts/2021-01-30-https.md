title:  "Finally: HTTPS Upgrade for Web Concepts"
categories: update
---

*Web Concepts* has been around for quite some time and started when HTTPS was not yet such a big thing. Over the years it became clear that I should update the site to HTTPS, but since that involves some DNS fiddling, I never took the time to do it. Today is the day where I finally made the leap, and I have added enforced HTTPS as well. This means that existing `http://webconcepts.info/...` links to the HTTP site will continue to work, but you will be redirected to the version that's served over HTTPS.

Hopefully nothing has changed for anybody using Web Concepts, but now you won't see these pesky browser warnings anymore. Happy browsing and if you have any issues with the new HTTPS configuration, please let me know!
